        <p class="w3-large">Just like words said out-loud, which we cannot take back, nostr notes are not meant to be
          deleted. Some nostr clients will let you "delete" them, which means your notes are tagged with your request,
          but relays can handle them differently. Some can hide them, others can append a note that you chose to delete
          them.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Nostr feels human and imperfect. It makes you wonder why you ever worried about typos or
          mistagging. Instead you can laugh at the imperfect nature of humanity. It doesn't mean differences of opinion
          don't arise. If we all believed in the same things, the world would be bland and devoid of serendipity.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">In a way, nostr could preserve a first hand account of human thought. No middle man
          rewriting, embellishing history or retelling a story from a future perspective. Nostr is natural.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">As your posts float in cyberspace and get shared between servers, called relays, something
          else is out there too. No, it's not an alien creature from a sci-fi movie, it's spam. A bit like galactic
          trash, it can fill feeds with mountains of gibberish, preventing real content and conversation from happening.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-large">One of the ways some in the nostr community are addressing spam, is through paid relays. At
          this moment, the relays offering this service, use it like a ticket in, where you pay a few sats (1,000 to
          5,000) to cross through their gates. Spam is generated in such large numbers, that having to pay relays, can
          add up quickly, hence deterring its practice. Less spam leads to a bit of zen, or perhaps eden.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Nostr thrives on freedom of expression. There is no perfect solution to address spam.
          Multiple avenues with different approaches will let people choose their nostr paths, whether they have sats to
          give or not.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">Social media is an extension of our social lives. As our thoughts flow freely on the
          keyboard and unto our nostr feeds, they meet readers on the other side. A post can become the start of a
          conversation. Threads are weaved, moments are shared, a community is born.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Nostr starts with your npub (public key). This long string of numbers represent your
          identity, in other words, your social self in cyberspace. Sharing that npub with someone you know often takes
          a copy, paste, and share. Nothing in technology should remain stagnant, code should be like a river in
          constant flow.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Some nostr clients are beginning to give you a QR code with your npub, to make it easier to
          share it. So, if you're meeting someone somewhere, like the nostrica unconference, you don't have to give your
          phone number or email, you can just share your screen with your personal QR code. As long as their nostr
          client can scan it, they should find you smoothly.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">As the world accesses nostr, we see a multitude of languages roll across the global feeds.
          Words unrecognized by some, their characters look foreign, but when we translate them, they are familiar and
          relatable. We are human and akin to each other. We all join nostr as a way to express ourselves.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">We see more nostr clients offering translations, removing barriers.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">We could also see the sparks of censorship resistance, as people in China joined nostr. The
          nostr community in freer countries openly reach out to tell them that even if apps are taken down from
          appstores, web clients exist, giving a space for voices to find freedom. China removed Damus for the Apple App
          Store. <em>May people always find a path to nostr.</em></p>

        <p class="w3-large">Nostr is like a decentralized fleet of ships at sea. Some days, storms hit those ships and
          nostr hodls on. Not every storm is a negative happenstance: A flood of people rushed through Damus' doors,
          when it was accepted in the Apple App Store. Access to nostr created a storm that tested the strength of
          relays.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">In real time, we could read how developers were bracing for the storm, how they fought to
          withstand it, and how, sometimes, stuff breaks... for a while. Then these notes and stuff transmitted through
          relays get built back up again. <b>Resilience</b> is another word for nostr.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Storms did not only hit relays, they also hit lightning, as new people on nostr continued
          the tradition of sending their first lightning invoices. Most of the weight fell on the Wallet of Satoshi's
          shoulders. Bitcoin has a similar ecosystem to nostr. In nostr you can discover various nostr clients, and in
          bitcoin, you can find many wallets. People began recommending Blue Wallet, Muun... to help with the high usage
          of new lightning zappers.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Nostr is coming to be known for breaking things. It experiences real life tests of
          scalability and it adjusts its sails to withstand future storms.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">Nostr is <b>interoperable</b>. If you've heard the word protocol tossed around, without
          knowing its meaning: Imagine if Facebook and Twitter were both written with the same foundational code, so you
          could enter both of them and access your profile, follows, followers, and posts on both of them, no matter
          which one you chose to use. People could find you on Facebook, even if you were only using Twitter. The
          difference between them would be the design and unique features they could offer you. Unfortunately, they are
          platforms choosing to run their own code, instead of running on an interoperable protocol. </p>
        <p class="w3-large">Nostr is different. It has a community of developers working on different projects. These
          projects all run nostr as their foundation. They could be thought of as competing with each other, because
          they can add similar features, and yet, each one also offers something unique. Every milestone each one
          reaches, makes the whole community stronger, pushing development and innovation into new horizons. It also
          gives you choice and access, unlike anything you've seen before. It's a win win.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Today we celebrate <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/damus/id1628663131" target="new"
