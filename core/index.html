      <h2>Protocols over Platforms</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">A protocol like nostr is interoperable simplicity, yet it is not a dead language. Its code and its upper layers get written like gears in constant movement, churning new lines into websites and apps. It isn't code that sparks out of nowhere. It's molded and reshaped by open source communities brainstorming ideas, listening closely to the people who use their products, and bringing those ideas to life. Each step forward carries new challenges, as the gears shape PR after PR, with products built and strengthened over time.</a>
      <p class="w3-large">We cannot know all of the work that has gone into giving us a door to freedom of expression. We do not know the depth of the countless challenges or the innovative solutions as they are placed into the code. We do not know all the layers of thought that go into keeping protocol interoperability while also driving innovation. We do not know the extent of positive effects it could have across the globe and into the future.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">But we have the proof in our hands that the work is happening. Every day reveals a new surprise, a different way of using nostr. New doors open, because developers and designers care about freedom of expression, and continue to build upon that foundation.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">A tool for freedom built by many, yet united in nostr.</p>
      <hr id="pow">
      <h2>Santa's PoW & network effects</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is like Santa's workshop all-year-round. Features are the gifts of products that have a direct effect on our daily lives. They can empower and protect the individual. Their foundational principles are the magic.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostricans around the world send their letters to nostr Santas in the shape of notes, asking developers for what they wish the most.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Open source is open, because anyone can add their grain of sand and contribute to a project they care about. It is work we can verify, looking through the GitHubs, and sometime in the future, the nostr GitNests of those projects we love.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The nostr protocol is a strong foundation to BUIDL upon, but its use and spread depends on its network effects. The stronger the community bonds, the stronger the protocol. It is a give and take.</p>
      <hr id="developer">
      <h2>Do you know your developer?</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">One of the strongest protections of someone's work is PoW and the network effects it generates as it spreads in the community. As long as we stay connected to the builders, no one should be able to come, clone a project, and take all the credit for other people's work.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">At the heart of every project is not its code, but its people. Grateful to all of you.</p>
      <hr id="whatIf">
      <h2>What if...</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">...we could break history’s cycles of oppression, where revolution after revolution has often meant that the “winner,” even when starting with good intentions, becomes an oppressor of the “losing side”, like an Orwellian Animal Farm repeated across the centuries?</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Imagine embracing the technologies getting built on an ethical foundation. What happens when we BUIDL on the principles of fairness, equity, openness, freedom of expression, love, integrity, truth, gratefulness and non-violence? What does that world look like?</p>
      <hr id="igotyourback">
      <h2>I-Got-Your-Back Protocol</h2>
      <h3>One client's win is a win for all of nostr.</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is interoperable. If you've heard the word protocol tossed around, without knowing its meaning: Imagine if Facebook and Twitter were both written with the same foundational code, so you could enter both of them and access your profile, follows, followers, and posts on both of them, no matter which one you chose to use. People could find you on Facebook, even if you were only using Twitter. The difference between them would be the design and unique features they could offer you. Unfortunately, they are platforms choosing to run their own code, instead of running on an interoperable protocol.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is different. It has a community of developers working on different projects. These projects all run nostr as their foundation. They could be thought of as competing with each other, because they can add similar features, and yet, each one also offers something unique. Every milestone each one reaches, makes the whole community stronger, pushing development and innovation into new horizons. It also gives you choice and access, unlike anything you've seen before. It's a win win.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">We celebrate the small steps forward creating new avenues of access to nostr. One client's win, is a win for all of nostr.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Interoperability means thinking beyond yourself, beyond individual products, into the possibilities to support the whole. #Nostr is an I-got-your-back protocol.</p>
      <hr id="openness">
      <h2>The rain of openness</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">“No matter how well you water plants, they can never quite grow like when it rains,” grandpa used to say, as he watered the garden late one afternoon, awaiting the rainy season.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">When we work on our own, outside of open-source teamwork, outside of opening resources for anyone in the world, it can often feel like waiting for rain. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Open-source has a way of gathering a unique mixture of creativity, coupled with caring about humanity, strengthened by a breath of freedom. It is as if it could rain on anyone and that rain could help buidl stronger solutions.
      </p>
      <hr id="responsibility">
      <h2>Freedom's Responsibility</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Technology, including the internet, has opened new worlds for connecting and empowering people across the globe. It is as if we have gained access to new dimensions and dissolved barriers between us.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">These dimensions are a reflection of humanity. As you dive deeper into how technology has been shaped and reshaped, you often discover widespread practices of dominant global societies with central organizations who decide the rules and the access. This leaves space for greed, censorship, corruption, data amassing, privacy infringement, and other practices that forgo a foundation on human rights for a foundation on control and maximum profit.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">It is a paradox and a mystery to think that those in power can institute policies that infringe on their own rights.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">As some systems build on control, surveillance, and maximum profit, others are built on the idea that "information wants to be free." In many ways, it not only wants to be free, it seeks to be freeing. It can be built on freedom, love, and individual rights. A challenging frontier, empowering technology calls upon each person to be responsible over our own lives.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">If you have lived under authoritarian rules, if you have experienced the ravages of war, if you have experienced the hardships of spiking inflation, if you have been censored for using your voice to defend human rights, if your bank account has been closed or worse for supporting a protest, if you've been persecuted for being different, the choice of personal freedom through responsibility is simple.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Technology is growing to allow personal responsibility and control over your own money (bitcoin), your identity(nostr, web5), your privacy(DIDs)... It gives you the keys to make choices over your own life. It takes responsibility, but it gives back freedom. A freedom we did not know we had lost.</p>
      <hr id="attention">
      <h2>When the currency is attention</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Generations no longer know what it was like before social media. Our lives have always been social, but what we do when the tools to connect are right at our fingertips can be an authentic creative expression or be primarily based on attention-getting. The latter can lead to an illusory metric of self-worth.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Creativity abounds on social media, it follows different patterns, like seeing the people we know modeling and curating their lifestyles, or being authoritative and accomplished. When we know them in person, we may notice how they have adapted to branding patterns dependent on the likes and comments to determine their self-worth. On the viewer's side, feeds may not be taken as learning or connecting opportunities, instead viewer's eyes hone in as if looking at trophies to imitate and compete toward.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The signals point to attention-getting as being a valuable skillset, looking at metrics to generate similar content to the highest performing posts becomes a practice, and getting an influencer's like becomes a reinforcement of their goals. Attention is key.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Short bursts of surface level information and quick emotional reactions abound, leaving less possibility for longer conversations and building niche audiences. Click-bait headlines are read and taken as truth, but not clicked-through and analyzed. Heavy tilting to one side of an argument, without seeing the complexity of each situation or reading into sarcasm, leads to divisions.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">All of these markers can distort our reality and generate the feeling of a marketing and branding competition with the empty goal of reaching the "masses" and becoming an "influencer." Creating content with the priority of generating attention, means being dependent on others to judge you, and just like one day popularity is flooding, another, cancel culture can be setting in. Often, people's self-confidence ebbs and flows based on these signals, or their lack.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Human identity is so much deeper and complex than what we sometimes experience online. It should be independent of attention and judgement. Being exhalted or put down shouldn't break the balance within, and when it does, it should be a moment to reflect and get back to the center. It should not lean toward what is likely to get approval nor should it be silenced by what is likely to be rejected. It should reflect us.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Imperfection makes us human, to focus on perfection and attention online, feels like when someone goes out on a few dates and pretends to be someone they are not. They may meet someone who is a pretender like them, but they'd be missing out on the one who loves them for who they are.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">When a new product feature is added, what do we hope for it? What are the incentives we are building into it?</p>
      <hr id="butterfly">
      <h2 >When you have a butterfly</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">As children, we often hear stories of butterflies. We are awed by how a caterpillar can become a winged creature, as if blessed with some kind of magic. It feels almost surreal to look at what seems like two different insects, and yet we know they are one and the same.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">A caterpillar is the foundation to a butterfly. It carries its bands of colors like projects carry principles. The difference is in how it moves. A caterpillar is significantly slower, its vision is limited to what is in front of it, it cannot enjoy gliding in the wind.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">When it comes to software, in order to become a butterfly, code must bridge with design.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Development is the behind the scenes framework that makes everything run well, design is what makes a person understand and use a product easily. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">If you bridge development with design, the human connection with the product is smoother, like gliding in the wind. It is understandable, like having the vision of a landscape from higher up. It is enjoyable and familiar, like a butterfly that does not need to think that it’s flying.</p>
