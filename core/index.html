      <p class="w3-large">A protocol like nostr is interoperable simplicity, yet it is not a dead language. Its code and its upper layers get written like gears in constant movement, churning new lines into websites and apps. It isn't code that sparks out of nowhere. It's molded and reshaped by open source communities brainstorming ideas, listening closely to the people who use their products, and bringing those ideas to life. Each step forward carries new challenges, as the gears shape PR after PR, with products built and strengthened over time.</a>
      <p class="w3-large">We cannot see all of the code gears working behind the scenes to give us the nostr clients we use. We cannot know all of the work that has gone into giving us a door to freedom of expression. We do not know the depth of the countless challenges or the innovative solutions as they are placed into the code. We do not know all the layers of thought that go into keeping protocol interoperability while also driving innovation. We do not know the extent of positive effects it could have across the globe and into the future.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">But we have the proof in our hands that the work is happening. Every day reveals a new surprise, a different way of using nostr. New doors open, because developers and designers care about freedom of expression, and continue to build upon that foundation.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">A tool for freedom built by many, yet united in nostr. Grateful to all of you.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Yet, at the heart of every project is not its code, but its people.</p>
      <h2>Santa's PoW & network effects</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is like Santa's workshop all-year-round. Features are the gifts of products that have a direct effect on our daily lives. They can empower and protect the individual. Their foundational principles are the magic.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostricans around the world send their letters to nostr Santas in the shape of notes. Asking developers for what they wish the most.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Open source is open, because anyone can add their grain of sand and contribute to a project they care about. It is work we can verify, looking through the GitHubs, and sometime in the future, the nostr GitNests of those projects we love.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The nostr protocol is a strong foundation to BUIDL upon, but its use and spread depends on its network effects. The stronger the community bonds, the stronger the protocol. It is a give and take.</p>
      <h2>Do you know your developer?</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">One of the strongest protections of someone's work is PoW and the network effects it generates as it spreads in the community. As long as we stay connected to the builders, no one should be able to come, clone a project, and take all the credit for other people's work.</p>
      <h2>On Interoperability</h2>
      <h3>One client's win is a win for all of nostr.</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is interoperable. If you've heard the word protocol tossed around, without knowing its meaning: Imagine if Facebook and Twitter were both written with the same foundational code, so you could enter both of them and access your profile, follows, followers, and posts on both of them, no matter which one you chose to use. People could find you on Facebook, even if you were only using Twitter. The difference between them would be the design and unique features they could offer you. Unfortunately, they are platforms choosing to run their own code, instead of running on an interoperable protocol.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is different. It has a community of developers working on different projects. These projects all run nostr as their foundation. They could be thought of as competing with each other, because they can add similar features, and yet, each one also offers something unique. Every milestone each one reaches, makes the whole community stronger, pushing development and innovation into new horizons. It also gives you choice and access, unlike anything you've seen before. It's a win win.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">We celebrate the small steps forward creating new avenues of access to nostr. One client's win, is a win for all of nostr.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">What is it like to work on nostr, knowing the protocol is open, accessible, interoperable and is running on every client, relay...?</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is a market competition, but not to win above all others, instead a competition to find your own unique niche, making sure it is interoperable.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Interoperability means thinking beyond yourself, beyond individual products, into the possibilities to support the whole. #Nostr is an I-got-your-back protocol.</p>
