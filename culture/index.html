      <h2>Beyond Perfume Rare</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Many years ago, I heard of a shop in Paris that could craft a rare perfume just for you. You'd be guided trough a multiple level process, selecting base scents to make up the different notes needed to create a custom parfum. The chances you'd have of selecting the same notes as someone else would be minute, but even if your choices were the same, its scent would be different once worn. Perfume reacts to the uniqueness of your body chemistry, and your chemistry fluctuates over time.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">As rare as it seems to have your own custom perfume bottle, it pales in comparison to the magnificent diversity within humanity, so it is surprising to see the multiple ways of trying to fit people into a small set of perfect boxes, often unrealistic and unreachable.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Not only can we not become someone else who is as unique as each one of us, but we should question why we would want to. Even a clone could not be you, because he/she/they/ze could not have the same experiences you have had.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Many times, these categories and stereotypes are said to determine our fortune, but only based on quantifiable qualities used to measure you against others, turning fortune into an illusion of a triangle with just a few people fitting at the top.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Life, however, is more like a turning wheel of experiences, and our fortune rarely depends on where you are on the wheel nor which categories you happen to fit into.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">In a similar fashion, sometimes products start looking like clones. Although some of the design features that make it to our hands benefit from familiarity, apps and websites also need something that sets them apart. A product maker can imitate, especially at the beginning of the building process, as they start to learn the tools of the trade, but with time, creativity should flourish.</p>

      <h2>We broke...</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is like a decentralized fleet of ships at sea. Some days, storms hit those ships and nostr hodls on. Not every storm is a negative happenstance: A flood of people rushed through Damus' doors, when it was accepted in the Apple App Store. Access to nostr created a storm that tested the strength of relays.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">In real time, we could read how developers were bracing for the storm, how they fought to withstand it, and how, sometimes, stuff breaks... for a while. Then these notes and stuff transmitted through relays get built back up again. Resilience is another word for nostr..</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Storms did not only hit relays, they also hit lightning, as new people on nostr continued the tradition of sending their first lightning invoices. Most of the weight fell on the Wallet of Satoshi's shoulders. Bitcoin has a similar ecosystem to nostr. In nostr you can discover various nostr clients, and in bitcoin, you can find many wallets. People began recommending Blue Wallet, Muun... to help with the high usage of new lightning zappers.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is coming to be known for breaking things, often leading to stronger products faster. It experiences real life tests of scalability and it adjusts its sails to withstand future storms.</p>

      <h2>Lost in the clicks</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Click, click through terms and conditions without reading them, click to close another cookie pop up, log in or create an account, otherwise be kept out.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Having access to information at the touch of our fingertips is a form of freedom. We feel connected, within reach. However, this freedom is not as resilient or as real as it should be. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Bells are ringing and it's not Christmas. Full inboxes, DMs, mentions, ads, notifications... Our way of life is changing. So much activity and information can distort our sense of time, as if it was no longer moving at the same speed. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">Time feels fast and fleeting, requiring immediate action. Piles of content means shorter attention spans, and FOMO can take residence, but only if we allow it.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Technology's ephemeral qualities make it hard to imagine the negative consequences to what we are giving up, what we are allowing others to take from our readers or customers, or that technology could be used against us.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">If we don't allow ourselves the opportunity to slow down and be mindful of our choices, we can fall for the marketing of what is easy and popular, rather than looking deeper at the substance with which products are built, or how they may best fit our lives.</p>
      <hr id="UFOs">
      <h2>Aliens & Unidentified Flying Objects</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">We may have bold and italics to give emphasis to text, but we do not have a way to signal sarcasm. In order to understand it, we need to be in the conversation. What do we believe? What do we mock? We often mock fakeness, lies, disregard for truth and ethics.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Life teaches us to laugh at our mistakes and imperfections. We can grow stronger when we can take criticism, when we can look deeper into how we work and learn from it.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Yet so many centralized bodies do not tolerate sarcasm nor criticism, as if they wanted to remain stagnant, when everything is fluid. Anything that remains stagnant weakens over time, as if it was blind to its mistakes. Holding on to a broken past in the hopes to retain a power structure prevents positive growth and innovation.</p>
      <hr id="orangepill">
      <h2>Orange Pill</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">In the bitcoin world, knowledge is a highly valued form of freedom. It is the "orange" pill inspired by the concept of the blue and red pills from the Matrix. Choose to take that metaphorical bitcoin orange pill and you will never look at the world in the same way. Knowledge has that power.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Orange pills symbolize a bitcoin culture that thrives on learning, testing, and solving for issues. Swallowing bitcoin concepts can be revealing. Money connects us, yet how it works and affects people's lives across the globe is often an unspoken subject outside of bitcoin circles.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The effects of an orange pill focuses on education and translates into real life choices that can improve people's lives.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Technology can BUIDL on itself across time thanks to the work and openness of many people. Bitcoin brings together a technological foundation from the past, adding to it, and putting everything into a one-of-a-kind <em>formula</em> built with the purpose of solving for many of the issues in current financial systems. (Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto et al.).</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The orange-pill effect helps people gain a deeper understanding of the gaps and issues with current financial system practices, but this learning process spreads further into other areas of our lives. It encourages integrity, fairness, openness, low time preference, collaboration, personal responsibility, critical and ethical thinking... It allows us to connect with our humanity.</p>
      <p class="w3-large"><em>As you look back on your own journey, what's been your favorite "orange-pill" moment? What did you learn? Has that knowledge carried unto other parts of your life?</em></p>

      <h2>Unconferences</h2>
      <h3>Nostrica</h3>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostrica may be an in-the-works conference, but it is also a vibe. It carries hope and nostr BUIDLing.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr is not a company, it's a protocol uplifted by a community which often understands decentralization, censorship-resistance and value for value. We journey together through sunrises and sunsets, gm/n's and pura vida's, bugs and features...</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The journey to nostrica has been one of bringing together the hearts and minds behind the code. Nostrica will not only be a place to reflect and celebrate on the milestones so far, it will be a place to BUIDL. We can BUIDL on ideas, BUIDL on nostr clients, BUIDL on community. HODL on, nostrica will be a unique time. Grateful to be living it.</p>
      <hr id="speed">
      <h2>Nostr moves fast</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">From the surface, it may seem impossible to be able to build nostr without a central figure dictating every move. Yet that absence is what makes this protocol move much faster and creatively than its platform counterparts.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Instead of a chaotic mess without purpose or vision, as one might imagine protocols to be, nostr revolves around a number of creative hubs with specific types of development and design. Hubs interact openly with one another, sharing ideas, issues to resolve, and milestones to celebrate... Each hub is a team, and development depends on how well the team can gel while retaining creative independence.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Nostr as a protocol works, in part, because of its guiding principles: Decentralization, simplicity, interoperability...</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Another positive aspect is the fun in building something that you interact with everyday. It feels purposeful to dig into issues and to find a way to contribute.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">It doesn't mean contributing is perfect, that there isn't overlap or mistakes along the way, but nothing is perfect. Nostr's ability to captivate creative people is what keeps its wheels moving.</p>
      <hr id="limitededition">
      <h2>21 million</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Bitcoin is limited edition. Only 21 million bitcoin will exist. Something rare, like bitcoin, is valuable because we cannot find nor create more of it. Like a hug from your grandma or loved one. Like that person who understands you like no one else can. Like milestones in our lives that cannot be replicated.</p>
      <hr id="self-custody">
      <h2>Self-Custody</h2>
      <p class="w3-large">Bitcoin is money you can control 100%, if you learn to keep it safely in your own self-custodial wallet and with your own keys. You will have no need for a bank or an outside party to keep your bitcoin, though you may need a third party if you want to exchange it for your local currency. These third parties are often called exchanges, and as a best practice, you should NOT keep your bitcoin in an exchange.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">To HODL bitcoin is a personal responsibility you can choose to take, instead of delegating it to a third party. It is a form of autonomy. The more we learn about bitcoin, the more we value autonomy. This makes a difference in how we live our lives, the responsibility and challenges that we take, and even where we choose to live.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">When something infringes on that autonomy, it makes us rethink our choices and look for possible solutions.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Getting lost in the speckles of your crystalline eyes,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">You remind me of what matters in life...</p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-large">Flowing in the depths of our souls,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Boundless creativity glows,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Like scintillating fireflies,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Attuned to the rhythm of our own song.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-large">Expressed through our DNA,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">To be human is to be creative,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Barriers be gone, we all got that spark,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">A talent that makes us an original.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="w3-large">We wanna be borderless, wanna be decentralized,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">In a way that gives us the keys, lets us decide,</p>

      <p class="w3-large">Remove the hurt of centuries past,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Where barrier upon barrier piled up no matter where we looked,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Keeping our heads buried,</p>

      <p class="w3-large">It's up to us now,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">It's a possibility beyond what those who walked before us ever had,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">A foundation for freedom to outlive us all,</p>
      <p class="w3-large">Built with love and fairness,</p>
