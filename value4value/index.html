    <h2>Mirror</h2>
    <p class="w3-panel w3-light-grey w3-padding w3-large">"Fix the money, fix the world"</p>
    <p class="w3-large">The advent of bitcoin has opened possibilities for "fixing" various flaws in the current financial systems, but our relationship with money should change as we learn to embrace a sustainable foundation.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Failing to change our thoughts and actions toward money can generate similar pitfalls and a reliance on carbon-copy uses built on top of bitcoin. This can lead to masking and removing access to bitcoin's freedom and empowerment.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Unnoticed, money connects us across the globe, much deeper than an electrical grid. It touches every aspect of our lives, from the material like purchasing a house, to the invisible like the memories that help in making that house a home.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">When we stare at money's face, we may see a reflection of every emotion we have tied to experiences across our lifetimes: hope, fear, dreams, barriers, challenges, empathy, support, love.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">We live in a world of contrasts. Money can be a foundation to gratitude or envy. It can help build a stronger future for coming generations or focus only on surface rewards now, disregarding consequences. It can be a fair or an unjust measure of our time. It can plant and harvest what we value, be it meaning or wastefulness.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Unbeknownst to most of us, many of the negative emotions and real life consequences we tie to money, are not just based on our life experiences but on how money's been built and managed.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Sadly, money often feels distant, cold, and, if allowed, it can grow fear, greed, ego, envy, anger, competition, and popularity in their most negative connotations. It is as if the human heart could be disconnected from anything money touches, turning it into dissonance, anxiety, and heartache.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">How we relate to money is often a reflection and a reaction to our world. As we dive deeper into the rabbit hole, we can choose to carve our own path.</p>
    <p class="w3-large"><b>What do we want to see reflected in the mirror of our lives?</b></p>
    <hr id="adaptability">
    <h2>Adaptability</h2>
    <p class="w3-large">Some say the technological age calls upon us to adapt at a much faster rate than ever. Our worlds are being shaped and reshaped by technology. Creativity flows more freely, easily, and with tremendous scalability. Human thought can make it unto a digital canvas at a moment's notice, and new breakthroughs are making the process more dynamic.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Photography was freed by the digital camera, though limited by know-how, place, time, and editing skills.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">AI latent text-to-image technology is opening new doors for people to become art directors and curators of what they can imagine and then describe. We may be growing stronger in our language skills in the process.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Ethical concerns exist, a much deeper and complex rabbit hole that I hope to dig into later on.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Information has always been controlled in some way over the centuries, as they say, the winners of wars are the ones who wrote the history books. The darkest of times are the most silent, as information is more likely to be suppressed in conflictive and difficult times.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Controlling a story and making it one sided paints a flawed picture of reality. It can be used to place blame on others rather than on the real issue. It can be used to generate fear or anger. It can also be used to quiet opposing points of view. Control of information is often a clear lack of transparency. It sits on murky waters no longer based on truth nor perspective on the complexity of a situation.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">As AI makes a stronger dent into our lives, many questions arise on both the benefits and the tradeoffs. If AI is based on a large sample of the internet, does it truly reflect humanity? Does it reflect every voice, or are its as selective as our history books? Can it be open and transparent, or are its workings hidden from our view? Is it a way to let more of the minority voices have a say and a freedom to express their thoughts? Likely to change the livelihood of many, could it also support people as they adapt to a different way of life? Can people better express themselves, not just in words but in images and video? Will we let it turn us into couch potatoes, or will we appreciate the sun shining on our faces?</p>
