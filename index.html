          <p class="w3-large">A protocol like nostr is interoperable simplicity, yet it is not a dead language. Its code and its upper layers get written like gears in constant movement, churning new lines into websites and apps. It isn't code that sparks out of nowhere. It's molded and reshaped by open source communities brainstorming ideas, listening closely to the people who use their products, and bringing those ideas to life. Each step forward carries new challenges, as the gears shape PR after PR, with products built and strengthened over time. </p>
          <p class="w3-large">It's a bit like Santa's workshop all-year-round. Nostr features are the gifts of products that have a direct effect on our daily lives. They can empower and protect the individual. Their foundational principles are the magic.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">Nostricans around the world send their letters to nostr Santas in the shape of notes. Asking developers for what they wish the most.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">Open source is open, because anyone can add their grain of sand and contribute to a project they care about. It is work we can verify, looking through the GitHubs, and sometime in the future, the <a class="w3-hover-amber w3-round" href="https://bountsr.org/code/2023/01/19/nostr-based-github.html" target="new" alt="Nostr Bounty for a Nostr-based GitHub replacement">nostr GitNests</a> of those projects we love.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">One of the strongest protections of someone's work is PoW and the network effects it generates as it spreads in the community. As long as we stay connected to the builders, no one should be able to come, clone a project, and take all the credit for other people's work.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">That doesn't mean people will not try. Larry Salibra cloned Damus: Its code, name, logo and all. Salibra shared the clone in the now <a href="note1hh7rndts8dqhkcamx2qv0gl0vjmdz3ynktsa2v6rhpzm0853nqkq363vwn" target="new" alt="Larry Salibra note">infamous note.</a> Salibra seems to have tried to steal Christmas from <a href="nostr:npub1xtscya34g58tk0z605fvr788k263gsu6cy9x0mhnm87echrgufzsevkk5s" target="new" alt="William Casarin on nostr">William Casarin (jb55)</a> and the team behind him at Damus.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">It's a night with clear skies. Twinkling stars spread across the darkness like decentralized relays. If only we could gaze at the starry night of nostr.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">Everyday we open a window to peer through conversations, waving what seems to be a flag of FOMO into the nostr cyberspace. But is it really FOMO? </p>
          <p class="w3-large">While, in other platforms, we may be distracted by ads and click-bait headlines that bury free human thought and conversation, today, we open our mobile phones to human connection, at nostr.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">What irony that today was a day of porn spam. Like a wave, it flooded the global feeds across nostr. In any other platform we may have heard outrage. Nostr, however, holds a different spirit...it begins with people asking what can we do about this? </p>
          <p class="w3-large">If you've been around nostr long enough, it is a place to openly share challenges and possible solutions. It is a haven for builders. Today, many were grateful that Damus blurs images of people you do not follow, without a doubt, soon to come to a nostr client near you.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">Nostr spammed back the spammers with a good number of jokes. Perhaps if it was some kind of a battle, I would say the jokes have won over spam. Even if spam outnumbered jokes, it was but noise compared to the high signal of the nostr community. Is the nostr community giving us noise cancelling headphones, even as spam scrolls past us on the global feed? I'd like to think that it is. That somehow, nostr strengthens how we live our lives, because we choose to be stronger in the face of challenges, and laugh about it along the way. We may never end spam, but we can end its hold on us.</p>
          <p class="w3-large">As I close off for the night, you'll probably get this tomorrow (depending where you are in the world), perhaps it will arrive like a newspaper tossed to your nostr front door.</p>
